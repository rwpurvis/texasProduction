# Texas Crude Oil Production
This is a Shiny app that displays the monthly Texas Railroad Commission crude oil production numbers by district, scraped from [here](https://www.rrc.texas.gov/oil-gas/research-and-statistics/production-data/monthly-crude-oil-production-by-district-and-field/). This app utilizes the `ggplot2` and `plotly` packages for visualization, and the `DT` package for table display.
